So I'm assuming a few things:
1) You are not expecting a complicated UI for the app, simply the demonstraiton that I understand how to use the framework to do computations and display values.
2) The data set is random and could cover a wide range of numbers from 0 to load testing level input.
3) You would value the opportunity to put in your own values to test the limits and durability of my code. 
4) You know your way around react and you have node.js installed on your machine already. If not, it's easy to install, simply donwload it from here (https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and you should be able to run this project with the instructions below.
<br />

If those assumptions are correct, please find the solution to the problem you proposed in this repo. If any of them are incorrect, please feel free to reach out and ask for changes and I would be happy to demonstrate my ability to adapt code to modified requirements. Normally on a project, I would go back to the user for clarification before coding, but seeing as this is an initial code check, I feel confident this will suffice for proof of competency.
<br /><br />
To check my work, simply clone the project into a folder, open a command prompt in that folder and type "npm start". This should pop open a window for you to play with my interface. I also alert several values in an alert on load when the page opens. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
