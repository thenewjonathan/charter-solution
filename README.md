So I'm assuming a few things:
1) You are not expecting a complicated UI for the app, simply the demonstraiton that I understand how to use the framework to do computations and display values.
2) The data set is random and could cover a wide range of numbers from 0 to load testing level input.
3) You would value the opportunity to put in your own values to test the limits and durability of my code. 
4) You know your way around react and you have node.js installed on your machine already. If not, it's easy to install, simply donwload it from here (https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and you should be able to run this project with the instructions below.
<br />

If those assumptions are correct, please find the solution to the problem you proposed in this repo. If any of them are incorrect, please feel free to reach out and ask for changes and I would be happy to demonstrate my ability to adapt code to modified requirements. Normally on a project, I would go back to the user for clarification before coding, but seeing as this is an initial code check, I feel confident this will suffice for proof of competency.
<br /><br />
To check my work, simply clone the project into a folder, open a command prompt in that folder and type "npm start". This should pop open a window for you to play with my interface. I also alert several values in an popup box on page load when the page opens to demonstrate and satisfy the requirement of "Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution" in the task.
